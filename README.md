<!-- badges: end -->

`shiny::runTests()` was added in shiny `v1.5.0`.  This function tests a `shiny` application (ex: `app.R`) using all `.R` files in the base of level of the `./tests` directory.

In 2020, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) supported launching [`macOS`, `Windows`, and `Linux` virtual machines](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) for continuous integration. Using [`r-lib/actions`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) to set up our testing environments, we can test R packages and shiny applications on all three platforms symultaniously.

This repo serves as an example of how to test your shiny application.

Features:
* Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions
* Template app from `shiny`
* Testing
  * Server code testing with `testthat`


# Steps to reproduce

Please follow the steps below where you see fit to test your shiny application.


## Set up App

Initialize a shiny application so we have something to work with...

```r
# Set up a new app with everything
shiny::shinyAppTemplate(".", examples = "all")
```


## Use a `DESCRIPTION` file

To integrate with GitHub Actions, we should use a `./DESCRIPTION` file. This will allow us to install necessary packages for running the application and for testing the application.

Packages needed to run the application should be put in `Imports`.  Packages needed for testing the application should be put in `Suggests`.  Use the `renv` package to help find all package dependencies being used in your application: `unique(renv::dependencies()$Package)`.


```r
usethis::use_description() # Initialize description file
usethis::use_package("shiny") # required to run app. (Imports)
usethis::use_package("shinytest", "Suggests") # testing only
usethis::use_package("testthat", "Suggests") # testing only
```

From here, feel free to manually adjust the title, description, authors, etc. This will not affect testing your application testing.

## GitHub Actions

### Copy

To download this repo's workflow file, run:

```r
usethis::use_github_action(
  url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/shiny-testing-gha-example/master/.github/workflows/run-tests.yaml"
)
```

### Manual

To produce this repo's workflow file manually, follow these steps:

* Initialize from a standard `R CMD Check` workflow:
```r
usethis::use_github_action_check_standard("run-tests.yaml")
```
* Change job name and workflow name from `R-CMD-Check` to `run-tests`
```yaml
name: run-tests

jobs:
  run-tests:
```
* Remove any `r: 'devel'` matrix configurations. These are not beneficial for application testing.
* In `run-tests.yaml`, change `Check` step to:
```yaml
      - name: Run tests
        shell: Rscript {0}
        run: |
          shiny::runTests(".", assert = TRUE)
```
* Remove installation of `rcmdcheck` in `Install dependencies`
* In `run-tests.yaml`, change `Upload check results` step to:
```yaml
      - name: Upload test results
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
        with:
          name: ${{ runner.os }}-r${{ matrix.config.r }}-tests
          path: tests
```
* Install `phantomjs` after the `Install dependencies` step:
```yaml
      - name: Find PhantomJS path
        id: phantomjs
        run: |
          echo "::set-output name=path::$(Rscript -e 'cat(shinytest:::phantom_paths()[[1]])')"
      - name: Cache PhantomJS
        uses: actions/cache@v1
        with:
          path: ${{ steps.phantomjs.outputs.path }}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-phantomjs
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-phantomjs
      - name: Install PhantomJS
        shell: Rscript {0}
        run: |
          options(install.packages.check.source = "no")
          if (!shinytest::dependenciesInstalled()) shinytest::installDependencies()
```

## `shinytest`

`shinytest` tests should be initialized on a local machine.  Be sure to run `shiny::runTests()` and save the results to your repo before testing on GitHub Actions!

`shinytest` performs visual testing in addition to `input` and `output` validations. The images produced by `shinytest` will most likely be incorrect if the R version and/or operating system is changed.

To combat this, we will only compare the expected images on the `macOS` operating system.

```r
# ./tests/shinytest.R

library(shinytest)
expect_pass(testApp("../", compareImages = grepl("^darwin", R.version$os)))
```

For easier debugging, set `compareImages` to `TRUE` to match your local operating system.
* macOS: `grepl("^darwin", R.version$os)`
* Windows: `.Platform$OS.type == "windows"`
* Linux: `grepl("linux-gnu", R.version$os)`
